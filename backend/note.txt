############# Observation and Complaint #############
I noticed the time different ( I picked 17:55 on the frontend and when i got email it mentioned 16:55)
I want to add more details to the UI (Make it more robust/production standard)
I want to add email notification option of 30mins or 60mins before due time so the user can be prepared
I also think of adding SMS alert (optional)
I also want to add delete all todo or delete as disered by the user i.e option to mark all, delete selected todo
I also want to add copy right below the page, contact us, live chat with support
the rendering should be for all devices, mobile, tablet, laptop. et.c all screen sizes.
